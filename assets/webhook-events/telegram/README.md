Test webhook events for the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

Each webhook event that reaches a Telegram bot is an [Update](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#update) object.

These test webhook events are taken from the [Marvin's Marvellous Guide to All Things Webhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks#testing-your-bot-with-updates).
