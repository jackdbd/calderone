Monorepo that I use for a bunch of stuff, managed with [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces/) (requires npm 7.x or later).

> ðŸ“¦ **ESM only:**
> 
> All libraries of this monorepo are published to npmjs as ECMAScript modules.
>
> At the moment no one of these packages has a CommonJS build.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jackdbd/calderone.git

cd calderone
```

Install all dependencies from npm.js and setup git hooks with [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/):

```sh
npm install --include dev
```

*Note:* `--include dev` is just to be sure that dev dependencies gets installed even if you have set the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` on your machine.

## Build

This monorepo uses [Typescript project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) to build all of its libraries.
Documentation is built bt [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).
API docs are built by [api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) + [api-documenter](https://api-extractor.com/pages/setup/generating_docs/).

Build all libraries and their documentation (code to `<package-root>/lib`, TypeDoc docs to `<monorepo-root>/docs`, api-documenter API docs to `<package-root>/api-docs`):

```sh
npm run build
```

Build all libraries, but with no docs (much faster, since building docs takes some time):

```sh
npm run build:libs
```

Build all development scripts in watch mode and all libraries in watch mode (useful for developing new scripts in TypeScript):

```sh
npm dev:scripts
```

Build all applications:

```sh
npm run build -w packages/audit
npm run build -w packages/telegram-bot
npm run build -w packages/wasm-news
npm run build -w packages/webhooks
```

## Test

Run all tests on all packages:

```sh
npm run test
```
