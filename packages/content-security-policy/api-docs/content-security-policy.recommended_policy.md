## recommended\_policy variable

Recommended policy for most sites.

Differences with the standard policy are the following ones: - font-src is set to 'self', to allow self-hosted fonts - frame-ancestors is set to 'none' - manifest-src is set to 'self', to allow a self-hosted web application manifest,so the website can be installed as Progressive Web App. Learn more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest - object-src is set to 'none' as recommended here: https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html - prefetch-src is set to 'self, to allow prefetching content hosted on this origin - upgrade-insecure-requests is set to true, even if I am not sure it's really necessary, since it does NOT replace HSTS.
