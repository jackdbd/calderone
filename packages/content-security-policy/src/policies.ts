/**
 * Recommended policy for most sites.
 *
 * Differences with the standard policy are the following ones:
 * - font-src is set to 'self', to allow self-hosted fonts
 * - frame-ancestors is set to 'none'
 * - manifest-src is set to 'self', to allow a self-hosted web application
 *   manifest,so the website can be installed as Progressive Web App.
 *   Learn more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest
 * - object-src is set to 'none' as recommended here: https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html
 * - prefetch-src is set to 'self, to allow prefetching content hosted on this origin
 * - upgrade-insecure-requests is set to true, even if I am not sure it's
 *   really necessary, since it does NOT replace HSTS.
 *   Learn more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests
