## makeLogger variable

Creates a logger with optional schema validation for each log statement, and that will either log strings + optional data, or JSON.

Each log statement you pass to the `log` function returned to this logger should have (and \*\*must\*\* have if you validate the log statements) a `message` and a `tags` array.

This logger was inspired by how logging is implemented in Hapi.js.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
makeLogger: (options?: Options) => (stmt: any) => void
```
